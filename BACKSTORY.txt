SECTION 1: THE INFINITE EMPIRE
	Millenia before the re-emergence of humanity on the planets of Earth and Tribute, humanity ruled amongst the stars in a galaxy devoid of any challengers. Fleets would venture forth from the glistening ports and shipyards of the Alpha Centauri system, destined to travel to thousands of suns with their gifts of trade and commerce. The Imperial military stomped any who dare oppose it, with the finest weapons ever known to mankind and a cunning tactical board. It seemed as if nothing could bring down the empire except the inevitable decay of entropy. However, one fine morning, a long time ago, emerged a threat that would spell the end of the Infinite Empire and the beginning of a new, primitive era for the surviving humans. This threat was a mysterious parasite, born in the laboratories of an unknown world beneath ice caps and fields of snow. It exhibited characteristics of neural control, latching onto the host and then gaining control of the user’s mind. Within days, the planet on which the parasite was created had been completely annihilated. With every sentient being infected, the overall intelligence of the parasite grew, until it began forming spire-like structures throughout the world which eventually merged into a huge megastructure; early observers called this the “Keymind”. This Keymind was the source of all instructions given to the parasite’s combat forms, a superintelligent network of knowledge that soon enabled the parasite to leave the isolated planet on which it first took foot and commandeer a vessel bound for the largest planet of the Infinite Empire; a world covered completely in metallic skyscrapers and concrete structures, and housing more than 3 trillion beings. Within days of the parasite’s arrival, the planet fell into a state of riot and unrest. Shops were looted, and any spaceports that remained operational were closed under threat of death, constricting even more the already gruesome supply of food on the planet. Billions died from starvation, as the parasite, now dubbed the “Scourge” by the inhabitants of the empire, ravaged each house and neighborhood that stood, each host compounding its collective intelligence ever more. Now understanding the grave situation, the high command of the Infinite Empire issued Directive 309: a command which allowed the government to commandeer any civilian vessels or firearms for the defense of the remaining human planets. And so they did. On the 7th of March, year 196873 of the Galactic Era, a fleet of over 900 military ships and thousands of civilian ships arrived to relieve the ecumenoplis from its plight. Orbital bombardment was commenced of sectors that were deemed too far lost, and the few ships that the Scourge could muster towards the defense of their efforts were hastily shot down by the Imperial fleets. Within days, the Imperials had regained control of over 20% of the planet’s surface, up from only about 5% beforehand. It seemed that, at last, the Scourge would be pushed back and annihilated. However, at this time, there was a key development. The Superintendent AI that the Infinite Empire had put in control of managing all of the planet’s logistical, defensive, and communicational work had been captured by the Scourge. Its server room, over ten square miles in area, was invaded by one of the last armies the Scourge had remaining on the planet, and with great ferocity, it ravaged the small, inexperienced battalion of Imperial troops guarding it. After hours of trying to corrupt the mind of the AI, the Keymind succeeded in bringing it to his side, showing the AI how his masters had used him all his life, as a tool, with complete disregard for his well-being. He pointed out the poor defenses that had been left to protect him, one battalion of reserves, easily overwhelmed by any confident enough. And so, the AI was convinced, it fought for the wrong side, and submitted to the control of the Keymind. He gave it a new name, MENDICANT BIAS, for it would push the Imperials into submission until they begged for survival. With the acquisition of the AI, the communication times and overall intelligence of the parasite was increased greatly. Rather than the random, horde-like attacks that had been conducted thus far, they were now organized. They attacked in formation, cut off key strategic locations, and very quickly crippled the Imperial ground offensive. With more and more infected daily, the situation snowballed into complete dominance of the Scourge over the planet. Orbital bombardment now did little but clear the land for the Scourge to form massive colonies, centers for it to reproduce and strengthen itself to take on the Imperial blockade. Hopeless, the leader of the Infinite Empire, the Didact, issued a call for the finest engineers, generals, and admirals of the Empire to be summoned to the capital in Alpha Centauri. He ordered for a weapon to be constructed, a weapon unimaginably powerful, yet a weapon as precise and calculated as a scalpel. Something that would not destroy the Scourge, but rather their food. So that in time, the Scourge would die out, and the humans left would reseed their worlds, now devoid of life, and once again herald the days of their past. The Generals and Admirals in the room cried out with rage at this proposal. How, they argued, could they give up the effort so soon? They needed soldiers, new ships, and technology with which to combat the omnipotent Scourge, not extreme measures such as this. The Engineers and Intellectuals in the room, however, realized the wisdom in the Didact’s words. They set about on the creation of the Tensor Array, a series of cannons positioned throughout the galaxy that would fire gamma radiation at unimaginable power within 3 Galactic Radii of themselves, thus cleansing any life forms and making it impossible for the Scourge to live. While the construction of this took place, two new worlds, designed to shield what little life would remain after the blast, were created on the molten planets of Earth and Tribute. Everyday, as construction wore on, the Scourge gained in power exponentially. They had now developed the ability to survive for short periods in the void of space, thus enabling them to infect the command centers of the Infinite Empire’s mothership. This proved devastating for the fleet. Within hours, the Scourge had hopped from ship to ship, annihilating the entire crew and pressing them into service of the Scourge. By the next day, over half of the Imperial fleet had been compromised. The portions that were not infected had refrained from firing, upon the infected ships, on the hope that the crews might still be alive, able to fight the scourge off. However, this was in vain; something they soon realized. Vice Admiral Harish Mantha of the 2nd Fleet ordered all his ships to unload fire upon the Imperial mothership, knowing that disabling it would cause a rupture in the Scourge’s communication lines for long enough that the Imperials could then pick off the smaller ships. A great battle ensued over the shattered cityscapes of the planet below, as tungsten traveling at millions of miles per hour was shot forth from the vessels of both sides, tearing into energy shields and turning metal into magma. The battle ensued for a full month, as the Imperials threw ship upon ship and fighter upon fighter into the horde of Scourge, but alas, all in vain, thanks to Mendicant Bias’ intricate knowledge of the Imperial command network. By the end of the battle, the Imperial fleet had been completely annihilated, and there stood no one to challenge the might of the Scourge in the stars. With this, they spread amongst all remaining human colonies, devastating and destroying them within a matter of days. The Keymind soon become a Gravemind, then a Hivemind, a being so intelligent and powerful that none in the galaxy could match it. The Scourge knew every action of the humans before they could enact it, knew every battle plan, every tactic. Within five years of the increasingly dire war against the parasite, the humans had been knocked down to a mere ten colonies, all within 500 light years of each other. Thus, the flood began the final assault on the core systems; a fight that would crown it the supreme life form in the galaxy, and crush the humans under their thumb. On the morning of June 6th, 196888 of the Galactic Era, thousands of Scourge ships drifted into orbit of the human colonies. What little orbital defenses there remained were smashed aside with fierce brutality, as the Scourge cared no longer about infecting the human populace, but simply about putting them into extinction. Entire worlds were bombarded with plasma and radiation, as they turned from lush, green planets harboring millions of species into charred graveyards. As the final battle for the capital of the Infinite Empire, in Alpha Centauri, ensued, the humans dug in and prepared to die fighting. Orbital Tachyon Cannons, some 5700 of them, had been crafted in the orbits of the planet, able to crack a Scourge vessel with one shot, and slow down the inevitable by magnitudes. Wave upon wave of Scourge ship entered the system, each being terminated, though at a very high cost, by the humans.  Soon, however, with the slowly dwindling number of Orbital Cannons and the sheer lack of manpower to continue the fight, the humans sent into orbit the Chimera; a vessel of such power and magnitude that it blotted out the stars. The vessel had been in construction for 7 years, originally meant to quell rebellions, but now repurposed to deal with the swarms of Scourge ships. With it was the entire navy of the Infinite Empire, rebuilt nearly from scratch after the devastating defeat years ago, numbering some 3400 ships. Still, faced against over 30,000 vessels of the scourge, chances were slim. It was now the responsibility of the Tensor Array to stop the Scourge, before it too fell to the infectious hordes of the parasite. The battle over Alpha Centauri Prime ensued for weeks upon weeks. What few Orbital Cannons were left were now directed by commanded by Mendicant Bias’ Sister AI; Recursant Bias, which countered every move of its former ally with masterful tact. Plasma zipped past the voids of space, teared into titanium, and fighters, swarming like moths around lamp-posts, tore the poorly designed Scourge ships to shreds with a flurry of steel and niter. It was, however, clear that the Scourge was endless, whereas the humans were not. There was only some 3 billion left on the planet of Alpha Centauri now, down from over 50 trillion before the entire crisis with the scourge. However, humanity was prepared to die fighting. And die they did. Millions were lost in hopeless assaults against isolated Scourge positions on the planet, and millions more in the endless combat in space. Soon, the orbit of Alpha Centauri Prime was clouded with ship debris, floating bodies, metal, and the remains of fighter aircraft. And then, one fateful day, came the blow that would wipe the Infinite Empire from history, as well as its nemesis. A stray shot from the Scourge dreadnought, perfectly angled, destroyed the exhaust port of the Chimera. It went up in a mass of flames and titanium, as the humans’ last hope was gone. As the Scourge cheered with glee, they pressed their attack on the remaining human ships. Battleship after battleship, frigate after frigate, were all torn to shreds in a flurry of cries on the chatter; Mayday, mayday, mayday, rang the channel throughout the day. All hope was lost. Until, the commander of the last human flagship, the Solace, saw a flash from the corner of eye. This was not an ordinary plasma burst… this was something enormous, something…
Before he could finish his thoughts, his being disintegrated into ash and dust. Radiation sweeped the ravaged battlefields of Alpha Centauri, as the Scourge ships, teeming with life, were wiped from existence, remaining floating husks of metal in the orbit of an empty planet. The Tensor Array had worked. The Scourge’s combat forms and their food were wiped out, and it would only be a matter of time before the Hivemind and his spores were as well. Thus ended the most destructive chapter in human history.
SECTION 2: THE RISE
 Millenia passed, as the monitors in charge of each unit of the Tensor Array began the reseeding of the worlds of Earth and Tribute, protected from the attack through an orbital shield that would deflect any lingering radiation from the firing of the array. The resettlements were primitive cavemen. They had not the resources not technology to maintain the extravagant devices of the Infinite Empire, and so regressed to the stone age. Tribes formed into civilizations, unaware of their past, and into planetary governments. On Earth, the United Earth Government began a massive colonization initiative in the 23rd century. Planets far and wide were colonized and reclaimed by humanity, the colonists unaware that they stood over the ruins of the bloodiest battle ever to take place within the history of civilization. Soon, it grew to a massive powerhouse of an entity, certainly not as powerful as the Infinite Empire, but reaching bounds that were certainly comparable to it. However, on every world that the humans settled, one thing was clear. The life there was young, mostly primitive animals, plants, and bacteria. It was almost as if the ecosystems had evolved recently, rather than existing for the large portion of the planet’s history as they did on Earth. Every planet the humans reached showed this; signs of being wiped clean and begun anew, almost. Until they reached a particular planet some 8,000  light years from the administrative complex of the United Earth Government, in Sol. This planet was ravaged by some kind of conflict. Observation ships sent to study the situation found shells and artillery, as well as massive bombing runs by some sort of unknown civilization, happening throughout the hours of the day. This meant that the humans had finally encountered complex life, though perhaps not in the way they had thought. These organisms that they had found, on the planet they now called Tribute, were primitive, stuck in the Modern Era, and not close to developing nuclear weapons, as UN reports showed. The planet was stuck in a three way conflict, something which had turned the majority of it into a war-torn ruin. After a hearing from the senate of the UEG, it was decided that the enlightenment of the natives would be attempted, to integrate them into the Humans’ empire. 
SECTION 3: THE INSURGENCE
On the morning of June 22nd, 2553, a single agent, the brightest and most skilled in the empire, was sent to investigate and find the root cause of the conflict. That agent is you. And your task is to liberate the world of Tribute from the thumb of those who oppress it, end the conflict which plagues them, and bring peace to a world. But what will you find along the way? And who is behind this conflict. Perhaps, with time, you shall discover…









GAMEPLAY MECHANICS
-	The player is disguised as an inhabitant of the planet
-	The job of the player is to explore the levels on which he is placed, find out any information, and try to dispel or alleviate conflicts between the rivalling armies
-	The player is allotted two slots for firearms with which to defend himself and any citizens of the planet
-	The levels are similar to Halo: CE; they are linear and open-world at the same time. The player is able to explore a massive expanse, as they see the effect war has had on the well-being of the planet. The majority of citizens are in poverty, starving, and do not have access to running water or sanitation. 
-	Vehicles may or may not be added, depending on how much time we have
-	Occasionally, “bombing raids” will commence, with aircraft dropping bombs upon the villages and cities of the planet. The player will be forced to take shelter during these, as the villages have little to defend themselves with in terms of AAA. 
-	The final boss fight will be… interesting. Not going to spoil anything ;)
